# fugleramme
Bird frame for Raspberry Pi or your homelab - real-time bird detection by audio, fully local AI, rendered as real, hand-cut 1800s bird illustrations. On an e-ink panel, a TV, or any screen.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Fugleramme has been selected for the [GOSIM Spotlight](https://spotlight.gosim.org/shenzhen2026/) at [GOSIM Shenzhen 2026](https://shenzhen2026.gosim.org/). If you're there, come by and say hi!

Live demo: **[fugleramme.arnegiacomo.dev](https://fugleramme.arnegiacomo.dev)** shows the birds heard in my garden in Bergen, Norway, right now. More frames around the world in the [Showcase](https://arnegiacomo.dev/fugleramme/showcase/). Full docs: **[arnegiacomo.dev/fugleramme](https://arnegiacomo.dev/fugleramme/)**

## Inspiration

A [WWF Verdens naturfond poster by Axel Thorenfeldt](https://www.axelthorenfeldt.com/news/wwf-verdens-naturfonds-fugleskole)
hangs on my wall, and I wanted a version of it showing the actual birds in my garden. Teddy Warner's
[AvianVisitors](https://theodore.net/projects/AvianVisitors/) gave me the idea of the live e-ink frame.

## How it works

[BirdNET-Go](https://github.com/tphakala/birdnet-go) listens on a mic and identifies the
birds. Fugleramme polls its API, matches each species to an illustration, packs them onto a
page, and redraws only when the birds change - on an
[Inky Impression](https://shop.pimoroni.com/discount/ARNE?redirect=/products/inky-impression)
e-ink panel or any screen. An admin page lets you configure what to show, and the frame
updates itself.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/redraw.gif" width="360"
       alt="The 13.3-inch e-ink panel flashing through its colours and then drawing a collage of birds">
  <br>
  <em>Full e-ink redraw (2x speed).</em>
</p>

Already run BirdNET-Go? Point the frame at it, on the same machine or anywhere on your network.

> [!TIP]
> The e-ink panel on a Pi is what makes it a picture frame, but neither is required. Fugleramme also runs in a
> container on basically anything - a homelab, a NAS, an old laptop - and the page takes the shape of whatever
> shows it: a TV, an HDMI display, an external e-ink panel, any browser, or your desktop wallpaper. Everything
> runs on your own hardware and works fully offline. See [Container](docs/container.md) and
> [Screens](docs/screens.md).

## Hardware

A Raspberry Pi 5, an [Inky Impression](https://shop.pimoroni.com/discount/ARNE?redirect=/products/inky-impression)
13.3" or 7.3" (Spectra 6), a mic and an IKEA frame. Parts list and supported alternatives in **[Hardware](docs/hardware.md)**,
putting it together in **[Mounting](docs/mounting.md)**.

I'm affiliated with Pimoroni - buying through the Pimoroni links or using the code `ARNE` at checkout supports this project.

## Art

Half the point of this project is showing off some amazing public-domain natural-history
illustrations. Nearly 1200 cut-outs covering over 650 species, every one taken from a
real plate and hand-curated for this project (no art is AI-generated, though some has been
retouched with AI).

Each bird is sized by real body mass, the larger ones toward the centre, on a textured paper page.

Coverage is best across Europe and northern Asia, good in North America, and growing elsewhere. Pick your
location in [Species coverage](https://arnegiacomo.dev/fugleramme/species/) to see which of your local birds are
covered, or [cut one yourself](docs/adding-artwork.md).

Species names in 40+ languages, see [Languages](docs/languages.md).

## Install on a Raspberry Pi

On the Pi:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnegiacomo/fugleramme/main/install.sh | bash
```

It asks where BirdNET-Go should run and which ports to use, then installs everything and starts the frame as a
service. A fresh system usually needs a reboot. Starting from a blank SD card? See the [install guide](docs/install.md).

## Run in a container

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v fugleramme:/data \
  -e FUGLERAMME_DETECTOR_URL=http://birdnet.local:8080 \
  ghcr.io/arnegiacomo/fugleramme
```

Kiosk on `:8080`, admin on `:8080/admin`, everything it persists in `/data`.

On a Linux box with a USB mic, this brings up BirdNET-Go alongside it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnegiacomo/fugleramme/main/examples/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

See **[Container](docs/container.md)** for more info.

## Run locally (for development)

```bash
uv sync                                       # set up venv
uv run fugleramme-fake-detector               # stand-in BirdNET-Go on :8090
uv run fugleramme-dev                         # start service on :8080 with hot-reload
```
